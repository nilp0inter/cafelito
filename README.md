# Introduction to Cafelito: A NixOS and Home Manager Configuration Framework

## Greetings and a Word of Caution

Cafelito is a personal endeavor in the realm of NixOS flake-based configurations. It's not a one-size-fits-all solution, but rather a highly individualized framework developed out of a need to streamline my specific configuration chaos.

# The Essence of Cafelito

In Cafelito, a "feature" is essentially a user-created directory that holds either a NixOS module, a Home Manager module, or both. This structure allows users to encapsulate specific system configurations or application settings in an organized and modular fashion. Cafelito facilitates the process of developing these features, but it does not provide them ready-made. Each feature is unique to the user's requirements and is created and managed independently, enabling a customized approach to system configuration.

## A Caveat for Potential Users

Cafelito is shared in the spirit of open exploration, but with a clear caveat: it is a reflection of my unique requirements and may not align with others' needs or expectations. It's an experimental project, not a polished, universal tool. If you're considering exploring Cafelito, do so with the understanding that its utility and effectiveness are not guaranteed beyond my personal use case.

Your journey with Cafelito might offer insights or pose challenges, but either way, it's a path that comes with no assurances. Delve into it with an open mind and a readiness for potential surprises.
